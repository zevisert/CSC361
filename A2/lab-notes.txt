Differentiation of the source of the connection from a packet
    - A packet has a src and destination, but these do not reflect the client and server directly
    - If just the SYN flag is set
        - then the src field in the packet is active partner
        - then the dest field in the packet is the passive partner
        - This type of packet is sent when opening a connection
    - If the SYN and ACK flags are set, on a packet following the single SYN flag packet
      then this the response from the passive partner.
        - then the src field in the packet is the passive partner
        - then the dest field in the packet is the active partner

The assignment needs to understand the packet structure;
   
    +---------+----+------+---------------------+
    | TCP/UDP | IP | eth0 |       Payload       |
    +---------+----+------+---------------------+
    

The program must accept a .cap file as a command line input

TCP connections are identified a 4-tuple
    - SRC IP
    - SRC PORT
    - DEST IP
    - DEST PORT


Pseudo code

    Main
        - check input args
        - exract file name
        - read the file
            - pcap open
            - pcap compile ( filter created before )
            - pcap set filter
            - pcap loop / next
            - pcap close
        - print the report
